# How to use this image?

## Standalone applications

Standalone applications are those where workspace.json is at the root of the app (a single-application workspace).
To run any command over your codebase, just mount it over at `/code`:

    docker run -it -v /some/local/dir:/code sencha/cmd app build

## Multi-application workspace

Besides mounting your workspace at `/code` you'll need to specify the application directory to work on. This is done using the `--workdir` parameter. For example, to build an application located in the `myapp` directory inside the mounted workspace, you'd need to run this command:

    docker run -it -v /some/local/workspace:/code --workdir=/code/myapp sencha/cmd app build
